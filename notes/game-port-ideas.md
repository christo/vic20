# VIC-20 Game Port Ideas

* flood it - choose a colour to flood fill, try to complete the whole in minimal
  moves
* not not - time limit response to exit the square up, down, left, right or
  possibly where such sides are colour coded. Follow increasingly complex
  instructions such as `NOT NOT DOWN`. Many levels defined.
* hole.io - you are a hole that must swallow everything that will fit, each
  object makes you bigger. Bonuses awarded for various focus themes.
* [stack](https://www.ketchappgames.com/game-stack) - isometric tower, coloured
  rectangular panels slide in from NE and NW to the top of the tower. You must
  "tap" to stop their sliding at the perfect moment such that the new panel aligns
  perfectly on the tower. Any overshoot or undershoot results in an overhang which
  is sheared off and falls away, reducing the remaining area at the top of the
  tower. As each panel lands, the camera view ascends, keeping the top of the
  tower in the middle of the screen. Panels slide progressively faster and with
  increasing frequency.
* (super) one more jump - one button puzzle game, you are always sliding, you
  jump with the button, if you jump off the edge of the platform, you gravitate to
  the underside, sliding the opposite direction.
